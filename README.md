A Concise Examination of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency for the Novice


Abstract
The recent increase of the price of Bitcoin has sparked an interest in the field of cryptocurrency and the technologies supporting it. Once relegated to the fringes of a few early adopters and enthusiasts, Bitcoin now sits squarely in the public eye. Those seeking to understand Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain are left sifting through conflicting sources with very little supporting documentation. Overly technical, or overly general, these sources fail to provide a concise examination of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sufficient for the novice or layperson to understand. 
Note, throughout this paper various sources are cited, however direct quotes are seldom used. This paper represents the sum of understanding from these sources.
